## Format for tutorials

Tutorials will consist of on-demand video presentations, and written materials presented in Jupyter notebooks. 
The notebooks should be complete and polished, amply narrated worked-out examples and exercises for participants. 

Tutorial basic format:

- Three or four Jupyter notebooks, each notebook = "one lesson" – printed, estimate between 10–20 pages, or 17 to 35 min to read
- Estimate the material is 1.5 to 3 hours to work through interactively.
- The notebooks are complemented with videos, 25–30 min in length (not longer); at least one video per notebook.
- One full tutorial may add up to total-time-on-task by the learners of about 4.5 hours.
