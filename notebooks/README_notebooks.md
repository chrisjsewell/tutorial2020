# Jupyter notebooks

The content of JupyterCon tutorials should be completely reflected in written materials provided as Jupyter notebooks. 
Worked out examples should be fully narrated, and no code cells should be left unexplained. 

Use a **naming convention** where each notebook file starts with a number, reflecting the order of the lessons in the tutorial.

List all notebooks in this README.

**Recommend** that all notebooks be shared under a dual license: BSD-3 or MIT license for code, and CC-BY license for text and media.
