# Slides

If the pre-recorded presentations will use slides, we request that you deposit the slides in this folder.

Use a **naming convention** where each file name starts with a number, reflecting the order of use in the presentation of the tutorial.

List your slide files here, with a brief description.

Consider using text-based formats for your slides. 
For example, you can write your slide content using markdown and use an app for slide design, like [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com) or similar.

**Recommend** that slides be shared under a CC-BY license.
